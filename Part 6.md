# Where to Go From Here

Congratulations! If you've made it this far, you have successfully implemented a genetic algorithm! Here's some things you can try now:

* Play around with the ```mutation_rate``` and ```population_size``` parameters.
  * I **HIGHLY** recommend doing this, specifically the ```mutation_rate```, what happens when you make it 0? 1.0?
* Use genetic algorithms in another domain!
  * Genetic algorithms are extra cool when you apply them to other things. For example, if you are good with video game development, see if you can use a genetic algorithm to generate characters or courses. There are many ways to do really cool things with genetic algorithms!
