# Introduction to the Project

To learn about genetic algorithms, we're going to use them in a relatively simple problem. We're going to writing an algorithm that will generate a given piece of text. How this algorithm should work is detailed below:

**Input**: <kbd>some text from the user</kbd><br />
**Output**: that same text

For example,<br />
**Input**: <kbd>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</kbd><br />
**Output**: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

<hr />

I know what you're thinking, this is a pretty easy problem. In fact, it could be solved with 2 lines of python.
```python
txt = input("Input: ")
print("Output:", txt)
```

But let's see how we could solve this using genetic algorithms.
