# Genetic Algorithms

Welcome to this code lab about genetic algorithms!

## Prerequisites
* Some prior programming experience is expected.
* Some python experience would be helpful, but is not required.

## Things to Install
* [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## What are genetic algorithms?
Genetic algorithms are algorithms used in Artificial Intelligence that are inspired by the natural process of biological evolution. Basically, genetic algorithms are used to find an answer when you don't really know how to find the answer, but you do have some way of judging the _fitness_ of a potential answer.

If none of this makes sense right now, it will later. Let's get started writing code!
